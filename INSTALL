'ash' installation notes ::

Tested with ruby 1.9.2p290

requires json gem, readline, and ruby built with iconv

I had some trouble on one of my machines, and this is how I fixed it:

if you're running 'rvm' you can install thusly:
 rvmsudo gem install json
 rvm pkg install readline
 rvm pkg install iconv
 rvm install 1.9.2 --with-iconv-dir=$rvm_path/usr
 rvm use 1.9.2 --default 

$ irb
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :001 > require 'json'
 => true 
^D
